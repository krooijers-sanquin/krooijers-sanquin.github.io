<!DOCTYPE html><p>Here I rant and vent my thoughts, so people who were fortunate enough not to attend my talks can also “enjoy the benefits” of my unique insights.</p>
<p>In my professional life, I squeeze biological insights out of (often noisy) datasets.
I enjoy the application of cutting edge statistics and algorithmics, and translating theoretical work into practical applications.</p>
<p>I feel particularly passionate about developing Bayesian statistical models, graph algorithms, solving/optimizing problems using SMT solvers, and of course getting linux servers to communicate in a hostile corporate setting, using ancient knowledge of shadow IT and intricate <code>iptables</code> and <code>wireguard</code> setups :)</p>
<p>I have a background in molecular biology (lab trained), and often marvel at the beauty and relative simplicity of patterns found in nature (both visually and abstract).</p>
<p>If you happen to have a desire to reach out to me, use one of the social websites, linked in the footer. I always welcome feedback. Opinions here are my own, and do not (necessarily) reflect those of my employer(s) … <em>although, of course, they totally should</em></p>
